README – Content Updates

Images
	-All content is images only. There is no editable text.
	-Images are inside the assets/images/ folder.
	-To change content, replace an image with another image of the same size.
	-Keep the same filename so no HTML changes are needed.
	-If you use a new filename, update the image path in the HTML.

Videos
	-Videos are inside the assets/videos/ folder.
	-Which video plays is controlled by the data-vid value.
	-To change a video, replace the file in assets/videos/
	or update the data-vid path.

Navigation
	-Page order is: index → secondScreen → thirdScreen → and so on.
	-Do not rename HTML files unless you also update all links.
