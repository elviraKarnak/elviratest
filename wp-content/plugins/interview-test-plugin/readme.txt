Interview Test (Vanilla JS)
==========================

This WordPress plugin provides a multi-step interview/test form built with plain HTML + vanilla JS.
Features:
- Questions managed as custom post type "Questions"
- Submissions saved as "Submissions"
- Settings page under Settings -> Interview Test (questions per step, colors, thresholds)
- Shortcode: [interview_test] to render the test on any page
- No build tools required

Installation:
1. Upload the 'interview-test-plugin' folder to wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin in WP admin
3. Add questions: WP Admin -> Questions
4. Configure settings: Settings -> Interview Test
5. Create a page and add shortcode: [interview_test]

Note: This is a minimal MVP. You can extend it to add charts, exports, and improved admin UIs.
